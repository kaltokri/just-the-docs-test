# Extensions
Extensions are external programs or mods that you have added to your DCS installation like SRS, Tacview, etc. 
(supported ones, see below). DCSServerBot adds some support for them, reaching from simply displaying details about
them in your server embed (LotAtc) to completely starting and stopping external programs (SRS).

## Supported Extensions
If you have looked around a bit, you might have seen already that I try to create APIs that you guys can use to extend
what is there. That said - there is a list of Extensions that I added already, but you can write our own. I'll give an
example later.
