You need to have [Python] 3.9 (or higher) installed to run DCSServerBot.
Just download and install [Python] from the website and install it with default settings.
Or you can use a package manager of your choice like [Winget] or [Chocolaty]:

- `choco install python`
- `winget install python`

After installtion run this command for a quick test:

```python --version```

On the first start all needed Python modules will be installed in an [virtual environment] in the subfolder `venv`.
If you want to know the needed modules take a look at `requirements.txt`.
