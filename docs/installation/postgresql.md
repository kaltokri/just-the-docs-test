DCSServerBot uses PostgreSQL to store all information that needs to be persisted, like players, mission information, statistics and whatnot. Therefor, it needs a fast database. Starting with SQLite back in the days, I decided to move over to PostgreSQL with version 2.0 already and never regret it.
Just install PostgreSQL from the above-mentioned website (current version at the time of writing is somewhat about 14, but will run with any newer version than that, too).
