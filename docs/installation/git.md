> The installation of Git is optional.

If you install Git and clone the DcsServerBot repository from GitHub onto your harddisk, the autoupdate will work out of the box.
You must ensure, that the `git.exe` is in your `PATH` environment variable.

Just download it from [git-scm.com] and install it with default settings.
Or you can use a package manager of your choice [Winget] / [Chocolaty]:
- `choco install git`
- `winget install git`

After installtion run this command for a quick test:

```git --version```

If `git.exe` is in your `PATH` environment variable follow this [guide] how to add it.

> You don't need to know a lot about git and how to work with it.
> All you need to use is the initial clone command, which will be discussed later.
> No need to learn a lot about git, because the bot handles all auto-update steps by hisself.
