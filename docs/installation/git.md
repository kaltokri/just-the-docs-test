> The installation of Git is optional.

If you install Git and clone the DcsServerBot repository from GitHub onto your harddisk, the autoupdate will work out of the box.
You must ensure, that the `git.exe` is in your `PATH`. A guide how to do it can be found [here].

Just download it from [git-scm.com] and install it with default settings.
You can install it with [chocolaty], too:

```choco install git```

> You don't need to know a lot about git and how to work with it.
> All you need to use is the initial clone command, which will be discussed later.
> No need to learn a lot about git, because the bot handles all auto-update steps by hisself.
