# Plugin "UserStats"

DCSServerBot comes with a built-in, database driven statistics system. It allows either users to show their own achievements like k/d-ratio, flighttimes per module, server or map, etc.
For server owners, it allows you to see which of your servers and missions are being used most, at which time and from which kind of users (Discord members vs. public players).

## Configuration

User statistics can be enabled or disabled in the server configuration (see `dcsserverbot.ini` [Server Specific Sections]).
Userstats needs the Mission plugin to be loaded first.

## User Linking

It is recommended that your users link their Discord ID to their UCID (DCS World ID). The bot can try to do that by 
itself (AUTOMATCH = true), but might fail, especially, when the in-game names and Discord names of users differ a lot.
If the AUTOMATCH is disabled or was not successful, users can generate a unique TOKEN that is being sent as a DM with 
```.linkme```. The TOKEN can then be entered in the in-game chat as a chat-command with ```-linkme TOKEN```.

## Discord Commands

{: .note }
> If a campaign is active on your server, `.stats` and `.highscore` will display the data of that campaign only, unless you use the "all" period.

## Reports

This plugin comes with 3 custom reports where 2 of them are available in two different shapes.
* userstats.json
* userstats.campaign.json (for campaign statisics)
* highscore.json
* highscore-campaign.json (for campaign statistics)
* info.json

All templates can be amended if copied into /reports/userstats.

## How to disable Userstats inside of missions

Sometimes you don't want your mission to generate per-user statistics, but you don't want to configure your server to disable them forever?
Well, then - just disable them from inside your mission:

```lua
  dofile(lfs.writedir() .. 'Scripts/net/DCSServerBot/DCSServerBot.lua')
  dcsbot.disableUserStats()
```
