# Plugin "GameMaster"

The gamemaster plugin adds commands that help you to interact with a running mission by either different kinds of 
messaging or setting and clearing flags. You can enable the campaign system in here, too, that can be used in different
other plugins, like Slotblocking or Userstats.

## Usage inside of Missions (Scripting API)

You can enable, disable (= delete) and reset (= delete + start) the plugin base slot blocking system (aka campaigns) 
inside of missions, too. If you want to use the system and for instance reset it on every mission start, you just need 
to put in the following lines in one of your triggers that fire after a mission load:
```lua
  dofile(lfs.writedir() .. 'Scripts/net/DCSServerBot/DCSServerBot.lua')
  [...]
  dcsbot.resetCampaign() -- remove, if you want to keep the points for players
  dcsbot.startCampaign() -- starts a new campaign (if there is not one started already)
```
This can for instance be used for some arena based game, which should start all over again after being restarted.
A campaign name of "_internal_" will be used in that case.
