# Plugin System

DCSServerBot is a modular system. It already provides a rich platform and many useful tools and utilities, 
but you can always extend the platform by writing your own custom plugin. The bot will take over the 
burden of making the different commands and codes available in DCS or Discord, but you still need to code 
a bit.

# List of supported Plugins

Plugin types:
- Mandatory plugins can not be disabled.
- Default plugins are enabled by default, but can be disabled. To remove them, overwrite `PLUGINS` in your `dcsserverbot.ini`.
- Optional plugins are disabled by default, but can be enabled by adding `OPT_PLUGINS` in your `dcsserverbot.ini`.

### How to install 3rd-Party Plugins

Whenever someone else provides a plugin, they most likely do that as a zip file. You can just download any
plugin zipfile into the plugins directory. They will get unpacked automatically on the next start of DCSServerBot.
