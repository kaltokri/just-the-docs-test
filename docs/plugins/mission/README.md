The mission plugin adds commands for amending the mission list, persistent mission- and player-embeds to be displayed 
in your status channels and ATIS like information for the missions' airports. 

## Uploading of Missions
You can upload .miz files in the configured admin channel of your server(s). You need the DCS Admin role for that.
Existing missions will be replaced (with security question) and if the server is running with that mission, it will be
restarted (another security question will apply). Newly added missions will be auto-added to the mission list.

## Auto-Scanning
If you set _AUTOSCAN = true_ n your BOT section of dcsserverbot.ini, all miz files that were added into the Missions
folder of your DCS-server (for instance via a Google Drive) will be auto-added to your mission list.
