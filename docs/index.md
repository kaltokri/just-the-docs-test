DCSServerBot is a tool written in [Python] to connect your [DCS] dedicated server with your [Discord] server.
This connection is bi-directional. The bot is able to get informations from the DCS server (like the running mission, connected players etc.) and displays it on Discord as server status embeds.
You are able to manage the DCS server with Discord bot commands to start and stop the server, change the password or the running mission and so on.

The tool has a plugin system, so it is easy to disable unwanted features. For developers it is easier to add new functionallity in the future.
Developers are able to contribute to this project by adding their own plugins by using the well known GitHub pull-request workflow.

You can control which user is allowed to use a specific category of commands by assigning discord roles, which enables you to use RBAC (Role Base Aaccess Control).

A scheduler is able to start, shutdown or restart your DCS server to specific date and/or times. Or to rotated your missions.
Support for additional tools like [SRS], [TacView], [LotATC], [OvGME] etc. is included.

Included is a kick and ban system, with optional support for auto-kick and auto-ban for team kills and friendly fire.
It can be combined with a credit system to earn credits for destroying targets or fullfill mission goals and a slot blocking system to reserve some slots for people with a specific amount of earned credits.

A statistic system supports per-user, per-server and per-mission statistics and can be connected to a cloud-based statistics, which is shared by some of the most popular DCS online servers.
To save this data the bot uses a [PostgreSQL] databse, which must be installed and mantainted.
If you don't need statistics and search a smaller and easier to install solution, you might want to look at my [DCSServerBotLight], which can do some of the stuff you see in here already, without the need of any PostgreSQL-database.

GameMasters can control a running mission via bot commands by changing mission flags or variables, trigger scripts and send messages.
They are also able to create and run campaigns.

You can enable a [coalitions] feature to support Blue and Red coalitions in your Discord and your PvP DCS server(s).
This changes the way how the bot shows informations to avoid spionage of enemy coalition.

It is possible to integrate the popular [FunkMan] Features GreenieBoard, Trapsheet and TargetRange.

This documentation will show you the main features, how to install and configure the bot and some more sophisticated stuff, e.g. if you run multiple servers, maybe even spread over multiple locations.
