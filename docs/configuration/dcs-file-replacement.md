# Custom MissionScripting.lua

If you want to use a **custom MissionScripting.lua** that has more sanitization (for instance for LotAtc, Moose, 
OverlordBot or the like) or additional lines to be loaded (for instance for LotAtc, or DCS-gRPC), just place the 
MissionScripting.lua of your choice in the config directory of the bot. It will be replaced on every bot startup then.
